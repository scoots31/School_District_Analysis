# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board has requested us to analyze the entire district involving funding and student grades and provide any new insights and performance of the schools. During the analysis we were informed of suspect results from a particular group of students at one of the schools. Our process was to perform the analysis twice - once with the full data set then again isolating the suspect data and excluding it.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade
  * Scores by school spending
  * Scores by school size
  * Scores by school type

## Summary

Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NANs.
